# Example Introduction with Markdown

Below you will find an example introduction written in Markdown. You should create your own new file in your cloned repository and write your own introduction addressing:
- a little bit about yourself, for example: your year and major, hobbies, and career interests
- describe any prior coding experience you may have
- tell me what you're interested in learning about this semester
- share some of your thoughts/opinions on large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot

When you're done:
- use the 'preview' button (should be top left of the text editor) to view your file formatted with Markdown
- make any needed edits to fix up formatting
- commit changes; with any commit you will need to provide a brief explanation of the change made. If Copilot is enabled it may suggest one for you.
- create a pull request (there should be a button that says 'contribute') to add your new file to the main assignment repository

# Bryanne McDonough

Hello world! This is an example of an introductory markdown file you should add to the repository.

## Who am I?
I'm an Assistant Professor of Physics at Adelphi University! I joined the department in September and I'm looking forward to getting to know everyone better.

My research is entirely computational. I use the results of massive cosmological magneto-hydrodynamic simulations to understand the evolution of galaxies and the struture of matter in the Universe.

My hobbies include:
 - crafting; mostly quilting, cross-stitch, and crochet
 - video games; my favorites include Skyrim, Fallout, Stardew Valley, and Animal Crossing
 - reading; especially sci-fi and fantasy, but also lots of other fiction, non-fiction, short stories, etc.
 - Lego; come to my office hours and I'll show off some of my favorite sets

## What prior coding experience do I have? 
Like I said, my research is entirely computational. So I have a lot of experience with Python, and have built complicated data analysis pipelines. 

I have built an open-soruce Python library for a specific research use-case. 
It's not on the scale of numpy or scipy (those take many, many people to build and maintain!), but it was my first experience writing code really meant for other people to use.

Most of what I know about coding is self-taught, which is true for many people. I did take a Computational Physics class that covered much of the material we will cover in this course.
One of the nice things about Python is how much information is available for free online. 
I hope to give you all enough of the basics and coding strategies that you all will be able to continue learning after this course ends.

## What am I interested in learning?
I haven't used Github Classroom before so I'm looking forward to learning how that works so I can set up a successful course. 
(I'm completing this assignment partially to learn how the submission structure works!)

I'm also interested in learning more about how students use LLMs for their coursework, and how I can help them use it effectively. See more below...


I'm also interested in learning about more machine learning techniques. Most computational physics/numerical methods syllabi I have found online don't cover much, if any, machine learning.
But ML is all numerical methods, and it is has a lot of promising applications. There are just so many applications that it can be overwhelming. 
I'm looking to recruit some guest speakers from my network who can share with you all the type of ML work they are doing, so you can see practical applications.

## What is my opinion on LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini?

### In terms of this class: 
LLMs are relatively good at coding, so they are proving to be pretty good coding assistants. 
I have been experimenting with using LLMs for coding, and while they can be a lot of help, they can also hurt when not used appropriately.
I get the best results from LLMs when I know what I am doing, and can guide it toward the proper steps. But I learned to know what I was doing (more or less) before LLMs. 
This tech is so new and changing so fast that there really isn't much good research on how using LLMs while learning how to code affects what you learn and the quality of work you produce.
So this will be an ongoing discussion in class, as we try to figure it out together.

### More generally:

If there's one lesson I have learned about using LLMs and machine learning in general, and that I hope you will learn during this class is:
> Garbage in, Garbage out

LLMs, and any other type of machine learning, are built with training data, tested with testing data, and then make predictions based on new input data.
If any of those sources of data are 'garbage,' then the output will be garbage. 'Garbage' can mean incorrect data, the wrong data for a use case, poorly formatted data, biased data, not enough data, etc.
You've probably already realized that you get better results with more detailed prompts! 

I do believe LLMs will have some role in the society in the future, but not quite as prevalent as it is today. 
My fridge does not need to be AI.
But there's been a ton of investment into this tech, and now those investors are pushing everyone to adopt it, because now they're looking for profit.
So my more cynical side is very skeptical of these big companies pushing the LLMs on us. Right now it is free and easy to access because each company wants us to get hooked on their product.
Once we are, that's when they'll figure out how to make money off of us. 
Google did this with Google Suite years ago. They used to give it out for free to schools, so students and faculty got used to using it. 
Now that it is status quo, they make the schools pay for access and more storage.

Also, who is deciding what data gets trained on? What happens when the LLMs start training on LLM-produced content? Who is going to protect human creators? Lack of regulation concerns me.

There's also the environmental impact to consider. LLMs take massive amounts of energy and water to train, test, and be available to users. 
And the big data companies get good deals from the electric grids, so it's often ordinary people who pay that price.

That being said, there is a lot of positive impact LLMs and other ML models can have when used properly. 
There's a lot of promising research potential, especially with specially trained models.
And LLMs can speed up a lot of busy work, used properly. 
However, just because something is made faster does not mean it was made better. 
So we humans should be intentional about how we use this tool and for what purposes.

Those are some of my thoughts. I look forward to hearing yours.
